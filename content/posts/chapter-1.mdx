Welcome to the wonderful world of snails! These small, slimy creatures might seem unremarkable at first glance, but they're actually fascinating organisms with unique characteristics and behaviors. In this first chapter, we'll explore some basic facts about snails and why they're worth studying.

Snails belong to the class Gastropoda, which is the largest group of mollusks. They can be found in a variety of habitats, from gardens and forests to rivers and oceans. What makes snails instantly recognizable is their spiral shell, which they carry on their back as a portable home and protection against predators.

One of the most interesting aspects of snails is their method of locomotion. They move by gliding along on a muscular "foot," leaving behind a trail of mucus that helps reduce friction and allows them to traverse various surfaces, even upside down!

Snails have some unique features that set them apart from other creatures:

1. Eyes on stalks: Most land snails have two pairs of tentacles on their heads. The upper pair houses their eyes, which can be retracted for protection.

2. Radula: This is a ribbon-like structure in their mouth covered with tiny teeth, used for scraping and grinding food.

3. Slow pace: Snails are known for their unhurried lifestyle, moving at speeds typically less than 0.05 mph.

In the following chapters, we'll dive deeper into snail anatomy, behavior, and their role in ecosystems. For now, let's test your understanding with a quick question:

<FRQ 
  question="Name three interesting facts about snails that you learned from this introduction." 
  criteria={[
    "Mentions their classification as gastropods",
    "Describes a feature of their anatomy (e.g., shell, eyes on stalks, radula)",
    "Notes their unique method of locomotion or slow speed"
  ]}

As we continue our journey into the world of snails, prepare to be amazed by these small but remarkable creatures!
