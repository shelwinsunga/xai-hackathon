# Lesson 1: Snail Anatomy

Snails are fascinating creatures with unique body structures. Let's explore their key anatomical features:

1. The Shell: Snails' most recognizable feature, providing protection and preventing water loss.
2. The Foot: A muscular organ used for locomotion, producing the characteristic slime trail.
3. The Mantle: Responsible for shell secretion and housing vital organs.

## Lesson 2: Snail Habitats

Snails can be found in various environments:

- Terrestrial habitats (gardens, forests)
- Freshwater ecosystems (ponds, rivers)
- Marine environments (tide pools, coral reefs)

Each habitat presents unique challenges and adaptations for snails.
